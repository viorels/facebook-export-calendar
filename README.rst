Facebook calendar export & filter
=================================

This is a tool that allows you to export the Facebook calendar and filter events by RSVP.
You can use also use the export calendar link from Facebook directly but that brings in all the events that you've been invited to befora actually confirming them so that tends to quickly become noisy.

You can see the tool in action here (deployed on Heroku):
